# Spyro the Dragon Bonk Counter

A LiveSplit component that displays the number of times you have bonked Spyro's head against an object in Spyro the Dragon (1998) on Emulator.

Supports Mednafen versions 1.24.1, 1.24.2, 1.24.3, 1.26.1, and 1.27.1; ePSXe versions 1.9.0, 1.9.25, and 2.0.0; and (allegedly) most or all versions of Duckstation.

I'll be frank, I didn't test most of these versions personally, I took it on faith that the addresses others found were the right ones.

### How to Install

See instructions in the releases section, to the right.

### Speedrun Legality

This component isn't (according to my own reading) obviously against the rules for submitting speedruns to speedrun.com, but it hasn't been explicitly cleared by mods yet. Use at your own risk.

### I'm Having Issues

Contact me on discord at Jaaaaack#8889. There are 5 a's in my name, and my profile picture has a giraffe in it.
