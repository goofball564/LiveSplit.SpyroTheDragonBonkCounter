# Spyro the Dragon Bonk Counter

A LiveSplit component that displays the number of times you have bonked Spyro's head against an object in Spyro the Dragon (1998) on Emulator.

Supports Mednafen versions 1.24.1, 1.24.2, 1.24.3, 1.26.1, and 1.27.1; ePSXe versions 1.9.0, 1.9.25, and 2.0.0; and (allegedly) most or all versions of Duckstation.

This component isn't (according to my own reading) obviously against the rules for submitting speedruns to speedrun.com, but it hasn't been explicitly cleared by mods yet. Use at your own risk.

Release coming soon.
